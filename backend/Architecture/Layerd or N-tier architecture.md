A layered or N-tier architecture is a traditional architecture often used to build on-premise and enterprise apps, and is frequently associated with legacy apps.

In a layered architecture, there are several layers or tiers, often 3, but there can be more, that make up the application, each with their own responsibility. 

Layers help to manage dependencies and perform logical functions. In a layered architecture, the layers are arranged horizontally, so they are only able to call into a layer below. 

A layer can either only call into the layer immediately below it, or it can call into any of the layers below it.
