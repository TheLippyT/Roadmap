Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex.

Why

-   Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
-   Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
-   It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
