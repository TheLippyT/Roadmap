A good design identifies the hotspots that are most likely to change and encapsulates them behind an API. When an anticipated change then occurs, the modifications are kept local.

Why

-   To minimize required modifications when a change occurs

How

-   Encapsulate the concept that varies behind an API
-   Possibly separate the varying concept into its own module
