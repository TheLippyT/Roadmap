> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

The law is related to software project management and was introduced by Fred Brooks in his famous book 'The Mythical Man-Month'. The essence of the law is that adding new developers to a software project does not make them productive immediately but conversely takes time from the other team members due to communication overhead.
