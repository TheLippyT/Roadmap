Reduce fat interfaces into multiple smaller and more specific client specific interfaces. An interface should be more dependent on the code that calls it than the code that implements it.

Why

-   If a class implements methods that are not needed the caller needs to know about the method implementation of that class. For example if a class implements a method but simply throws then the caller will need to know that this method shouldn't actually be called.

How

-   Avoid fat interfaces. Classes should never have to implement methods that violate theÂ [[Single Responsibility Principle]]
