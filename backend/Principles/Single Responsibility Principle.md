A class should never have more than one reason to change.

Long version: Every class should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. Responsibility can be defined as a reason to change, so a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.

Why

-   Maintainability: changes should be necessary only in one module or class.

How

-   ApplyÂ [[Curly's Law]].
