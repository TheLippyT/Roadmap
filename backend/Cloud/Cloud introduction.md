## Overview of cloud computing

##### Definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing

Cloud computing:

A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

Example of computing resources include:
-   Networks
-   Servers
-   Storage
-   Application
-   Services

Cloud model
-   5 essential chracteristics
-   3 deplyment models
-   3 service models

5 essential characteristics
1.  On-demand self-service
	1.  You get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider
2.  Broad network access
	1.  Cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations
3.  Resource pooling
	1. ![[Pasted image 20230213113006.png]]
	2. 1.  What gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost efficient
	3.  Resources dynamically assigned based on demand
4. 1.  Rapid elasticity
	1.  You can access more resources when you need them, annd scale back when you don't
5.  Measured service
	1.  You only pay for what you use or reserve as you go
	2.  Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparantly based on utilization

3 types of cloud deployment models
-   Public
	-   Leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies
-   Private
	-   The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, and operated by a service provider
-   Hybrid
	-   Mix of both public and private clouds working together seamlessly

##### History and evolution of cloud computing

1950s

-   Large-scale mainframes with high-volume processing power
-   The practice of time sharing, or resource pooling evolved
-   Multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and cpu power

1970

-   Virtual machines
-   Mainframes to have multiple virtual systems, or virtual machines on a single physical node

Vms

-   multiple distinct compute environements on the same physical hardware
-   Each virtual machine hosted guest operating systems that behaved as athough they had their own bare metal resources

Virtualization

-   Huge catalyst for evolution in computing

Hypervisor

-   A small software layer that enabled multiple operating systems to run alongside each other sharing the same physical computing resources
