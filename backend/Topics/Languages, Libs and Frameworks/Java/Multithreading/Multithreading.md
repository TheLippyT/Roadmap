When we run a real-world application, we use good processors for faster execution. But, only processor speed canâ€™t make your application run fast. One of the great ways to create a performance efficient application is use utilize multithreading.

# What is multithreading

Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel. A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them.

# JVM and threads

there is no limit of threads that the JVM can make. the limiting factor is the underlying hardware the application is ran on

# Multithreading vs Multiprocessing

both mutlithreading and multiprocessing is used to achieve multitasking(executing multiple tasks simultaniously)

difference between multithreading and multiprocessing

- multiprocessing
multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to have more than one CPU or processor core, each of which can execute threads concurrently. This allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently across multiple CPUs or processor cores.

- multithreading
multithreading is used to improve the performance of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks concurrently within a single program, while multiprocessing is used to improve the performance of a program by allowing it to use multiple CPUs or processor cores to execute tasks concurrently.
